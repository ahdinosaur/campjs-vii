### example: global socio-economic networks

the economy is converging on mega-corporations, at the expense of small business.

many of these mega-corps act as middleman within closed markets: Uber.

???

- peer -> middleman -> peer
  - where middleman sets price for both supplier and consumer
  - workers on both sides assume all risk, no risk for middleman
- winner-take-all effects of global networks (Uber)

## agent trust networks

> @dominictarr: you just interact with your friends, etc, and following someone is basically saying "this user is a real human, not a bot, and not a scammer" That is a expression of trust. Sometimes they may make a mistake, and trust someone who turns out to be a jerk, for this reason, trust must be revokeable.
Thus, instead of just signing each other's keys (as in gpg) we need to be able to sign a variety of statements about those keys. Those keys must also sign statements about other things (posts, or links to external files etc) so that the statements about those external things are tied into a specific context.

> @mixmix: My favourite way of thinking about all this is that truly decentralised p2p is actually alarmingly similar to your everyday social interactions - no-one is really a boss, anyone can lie, trust matters, and you ignore stuff and people that have bad reputation.
Also, no-one can stop you talking with friends... and you don't need to be able to reach america to be able to talk
