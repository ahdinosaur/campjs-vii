### example: global socio-economic networks

the economy is converging on mega-corporations, at the expense of small business.

many of these mega-corps act as middleman within closed markets: Uber.

???

- peer -> middleman -> peer
  - where middleman sets price for both supplier and consumer
  - workers on both sides assume all risk, no risk for middleman
- winner-take-all effects of global networks (Uber)

???

- also anonymous network
- nodes can count up according to one-two-many principle


### beeping

fly brains specialize cells with Max Independent Set

beeping: 

- only message sent or received is a beep (unary signal)
- anonymous broadcast network where nodes have no knowledge of topology or size
- in each time slot, a node can either beep or be silent
- beeping nodes cannot determine if other nodes beeped as well
- silent nodes can only differentiate between no neighbors beeping or at least one neighbors beeping

fly brains: developing fly brains select a subset of cells to become sensory bristles on the fly's forehead.

- cell differentiation

### example: brain

blood-brain barrier protects brain from bad actors.

example: brains are composed of fractal agents

> Thus there is, in this view, an internal 'economy' in the brain, in which neurons must compete with each other for resources. This design stands in contrast to the standard, Von Neumann computer architecture, whose parts never have to worry about where their energy is coming from. Without resource contention, there's no need for selfishness. And this is, in part, why computers are less flexible and adaptable — less plastic — than brains.

## agent trust networks

> @dominictarr: you just interact with your friends, etc, and following someone is basically saying "this user is a real human, not a bot, and not a scammer" That is a expression of trust. Sometimes they may make a mistake, and trust someone who turns out to be a jerk, for this reason, trust must be revokeable.
Thus, instead of just signing each other's keys (as in gpg) we need to be able to sign a variety of statements about those keys. Those keys must also sign statements about other things (posts, or links to external files etc) so that the statements about those external things are tied into a specific context.

> @mixmix: My favourite way of thinking about all this is that truly decentralised p2p is actually alarmingly similar to your everyday social interactions - no-one is really a boss, anyone can lie, trust matters, and you ignore stuff and people that have bad reputation.
Also, no-one can stop you talking with friends... and you don't need to be able to reach america to be able to talk

## permaculture

- symbiotic relationships
  - companion planting (e.g. carrots with sage)
  - 1 + 1 = 3

### leaders

alpha wolf is boss of pack, not boss of all packs.

large molecule doesn't get bonus and become organelle
