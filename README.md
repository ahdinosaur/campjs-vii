# nature's best practices for distributed systems

hi, i'm Mikey (@ahdinosaur)

???

i have no idea what i'm saying

- https://blog.dinosaur.is/life-as-a-holon/
- https://github.com/ssbc/secure-scuttlebutt/issues/65: trustless trust 
- https://github.com/ssbc/secure-scuttlebutt/issues/86: subjective data structures

## systems 101

- networks: who you connect to
- signals: what you say

## distributed trust-less

- networks: any peer can connect to any other peer
- signals: global consensus protocols

## buying a bicycle

let's say i'm buying a bicycle from a neighbor.

why should i have to connect to some random strangers to participate in a global consensus process in order to send digital coins to my neighbor?

i trust my neighbor more than strangers.

## decentralized trust-ful

- networks: you connect to peers you trust
- signals: local subjective protocols
